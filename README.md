- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrmzz !
- 👀 As a linguist and translator, I’m manly interested in NLP. I've learned to code in Python on my own during my PhD thesis and my experience working in companies. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Machine Learning to boast my projects perfomances.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on NLP projects where my background in theoretical linguistics is valuable to analyse results or data. I believe Machine Learning and Rules-based approaches should coexist and help each other find the best results.
